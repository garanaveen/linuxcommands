alias ff

Edit such that gg can take parameters that are passed as parameters to grep
scripts/grepquicknotes.sh
Like you should be able to specify more parameters to grep like 

gg set-url --exclude-dir=.git #This should exclude the director ".git"

Implement vimff that takes a parameters as the fileName and opens the first occurance of the file.
