# @todo :

# Write a python script to find unused assets in a project.

# The script should take a directory path under which the assets are stored. The script should os.walk the directory and find all files with extensions .png, .webp

# The script should then check if these files are used in the project by searching for their references in the codebase. If any assets are not referenced in the codebase, they should be printed as such.

# The repository should be the one where the script is run from.
